### Genre Prediction form Movie Plots
Creating models that can pedict a movie's genre given its plot summary on wikipedia.

### Project Overview
Wil create modles using both a document-level and a sentence-level approach. The sentence-level might be useful as it the increases in contextual nuance and overall training data (every record represents a sentence instead of a whole document) which may improve model performance.

The machine learning models that I will use for this project are:
- Random Forest
- SVM
- Gradient Boosting
- LSTM

### Data Source
The dataset contains descriptions of 34,886 movies from around the world and is available on kaggle.
